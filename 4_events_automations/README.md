# Automations, Events, and Incidents Quickstart

## 1. Create a notification [automation](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/automations/) that fires on flow run completion.
1. Find the Automations page in the UI and click the `+` button.
2. Define your trigger:

    Add your own email.

3. Define your action:

    Use the block you created during the [blocks quickstart](../3_blocks_integrations/README.md).

4. Name your automation:
    ![Alt text](automation_name.png)
5. Run a deployment (ensure that it meets the criteria set in your automation's trigger, eg. the tags `pacc` and `taylor`)

## 2. Browse the [events](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/events/) dashboard.

1. See if you can spot the events related to the automation you just created:

1. What about events related to your deployment?
    ![Alt text](event_feed_deployments.png)
1. Checkout infrastructure related events associated with your deployment:
    ![Alt text](event_feed_docker.png)
1. How about events relating to the blocks you created today?

1. Click on the `Flow run` of a Block event to see _when_ the method was called during the flow's execution:

## 3. Advanced Automations: Create a [custom trigger](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/automations/#custom-triggers) and compound [actions](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/automations/#actions)

In this example, you'll create a custom trigger that results in an action of a [toy webhook](https://webhook.site/) being called.

1. Find an block based event in the event feed and click into the event details.
    Filter by Resource:
    ![Alt text](block_filter.png)
2. Click on the `Raw` tab to review the event's JSON values then click on the three dots at the top right and click `Automate`.
    ![Alt text](event_automate_button.png)

    You'll see we can describe a custom triggering event using JSON:
    ![Alt text](custom_trigger.png)

    **Note:** There are many things we can do to fine tune this custom trigger. For example, we could change the threshold from 1 to 2 if we want this event to occur twice before triggering any action. For more information on trigger grammar, check out [these docs](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/automations/#custom-triggers).

3. For the action select `Call a webhook` define a webhook block.
    1. First get a toy webhook endpoint at [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
    2. Copy your unique URL
    3. Back in Prefect's UI, select the action `Call a webhook`
    4. `Add +` a webhook block, past in your unique URL from Webhook.site, and click `Create`.
    ![Alt text](create_webhook_block.png)
4. Add another action to notify yourself about this. Your `Actions` page should look something like:
    ![Alt text](compound_actions.png)
5. Call your Automation something like `taylor-pacc-json-block-automation` and save.
6.  Run your flow that loads the block, something like:
    ```python
    from prefect import flow, task
    from prefect.blocks.system import JSON

    @task
    def load_block():
        jb = JSON.load("taylor-pacc-json-block")
        my_dict = jb.value

        print(my_dict)

    @flow(log_prints=True)
    def load_block_flow():
        load_block()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        load_block_flow()
    ```
7. Verify that you got a notification email and verify that the webhook was called.
TODO: Why multiple webhook calls?

## 4. Declare and resolve a [Prefect Incident](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/cloud/incidents/)
1. Find the `Incidents` page and click the `+` button.
2. Define a test incident, call it something like `your-name-pacc-test` and click `Declare`:
    ![Alt text](declare_incident.png)
3. Add a test comment.
4. Navigate to the `Flow Runs` page and find a failed flow run. (Notice the AI Error Summaries)
    ![Alt text](failed_flow_runs.png)
    
5. Click into a failed flow run, click on the three dots, and then click `Add to incident` 
    ![Alt text](add_to_incident.png)
6. Change the severity of the incident.
7. Mark the incident as resolved. âœ…
