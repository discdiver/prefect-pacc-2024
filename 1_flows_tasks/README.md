# Basic Syntax Quickstart

![Alt text](images/flow_task_diagrams.png)

### Rules of Thumb
- At a minimum, you need to define at least one flow function.
- Your flows can be segmented by introducing task (`@task`) functions, which can be invoked from within these flows.
- A task represents a discrete unit of Python code, whereas flows are more akin to parent functions accommodating a broad range of workflow logic.
- Flows can be called inside of other flows (we call these subflows) but a task **cannot** be run inside of another task or from outside the context of a flow.

## Module 1 Lab

1. **Create your first [flows](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/flows/#writing-flows) and [tasks](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/tasks/#tasks-overview) modeled off the [basic-syntax](basic_syntax.py) script.**

    `basic_syntax.py`
    ```python
    import httpx  # requests capability, but can work with async
    from prefect import flow, task

    # Tasks run inside flows.
    # Flows are the main unit of execution in Prefect, they can be scheduled

    @task
    def fetch_weather(lat: float, lon: float):
        base_url = "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast/"
        weather = httpx.get(
            base_url,
            params=dict(latitude=lat, longitude=lon, hourly="temperature_2m"),
        )
        most_recent_temp = float(weather.json()["hourly"]["temperature_2m"][0])
        return most_recent_temp


    # Tasks can't run inside other tasks.
    @task
    def save_weather(temp: float):
        with open("weather.csv", "w+") as w:
            w.write(str(temp))
        return "Successfully wrote temp"


    # Flows CAN run inside other flows.
    # Docs: https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/flows/#composing-flows
    @flow
    def my_subflow():
        return "Flows can run inside other flows"


    @flow
    def pipeline(lat: float = 38.9, lon: float = -77.0):
        temp = fetch_weather(lat, lon)
        weather = save_weather(temp)
        subflow_result = my_subflow()
        return {"weather": weather, "subflow": subflow_result}


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        pipeline()
    ```
    - Run your flow locally and verify that the flow run shows up in the UI. 
    - Head to the `Flow Runs` page in the UI and click on the animal-adjective flow run name to see your flow run page.

2. **Try adding [caching](caching_tasks.py) and [retries](retries.py) to your tasks and flows.**
    ```python
    from prefect import flow, task
    from prefect.tasks import task_input_hash, exponential_backoff
    from datetime import timedelta

    @task(cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(minutes=30))
    def hello_task(name_input):
        print(f"Hello {name_input}!")
    
    @task(retries=4, retry_delay_seconds=0.1)
    def fetch_cat_fact():
        cat_fact = httpx.get("https://httpstat.us/Random/200,500", verify=False)
        if cat_fact.status_code >= 400:
            raise Exception()
        print(cat_fact.text)
    ```
    - Verify that the tasks show up in a cached state.
    - Head to the `Task Runs` tab of the flow run page.

    - [Custom Retry Behavior](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/tasks/#custom-retry-behavior)
---
3. Add a [custom log](custom_logs.py):
    ```python
    from prefect import flow, get_run_logger

    @flow(name="log-example-flow")
    def log_it():
        logger = get_run_logger()
        logger.info("INFO level log message.")
        logger.debug("You only see this message if the logging level is set to DEBUG. ðŸ™‚")

    ```
    - Verify that this log shows up in the UI.
    - Check out the logs in the `Logs` tab of the flow run page.
---
4. Optional: Generate an [artifact](prefect_artifact.py) in one of your tasks or flows.
    ```python
    import httpx
    from prefect import flow, task
    from prefect.artifacts import create_markdown_artifact

    @task
    def mark_it_down(temp):
        markdown_report = f"""# Weather Report        
        ## Recent weather

        | Time        | Temperature |
        |:--------------|-------:|
        | Now | {temp} |
        | In 1 hour       | {temp + 2} |
        """
        create_markdown_artifact(
            key="weather-report",
            markdown=markdown_report,
            description="Very scientific weather report",
        )
    ```
    - Verify that the artifact shows up in the Artifacts tab of the flow run page.
