# Custom Events and Webhooks Quickstart

There are two ways to get things that happen outside of Prefect into your workspace's event feed, Event Webhooks, and Custom Emitted Events.

### Create and call an [Event Webhook](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/guides/webhooks/).
1. Find the Event Webhooks page and create an Event Webhook.
